# Day Planner

<a href="https://mattdunks94.github.io/my-second-project/">Day Planner</a> is an application that demonstrates basic use of Javascript. The app is targeted for people who like to plan and organise their day ahead.
The app is a fully responsive site on most devices and allows users to add, edit times and remove activites/events from their day planner.

## Features

### Adding Activities:

</ul>

### Set Activity Start Time:
<ul>
  <li>The 'set start time' feature enables the user to set the start time of an activity. The user can do this by clicking on the input type itself (time input) and select desired time or type in start time.</li>
</ul>

### Removing Activities:
<ul>
  <li>The remove activity feature is self explanatory. The user can remove activities by clicking on the 'X', which is located beside the activity entered. This element also has a hover effect. When hovering over the 'X' it turns red. This indicates to the user that it does something important.(see image below for the add, remove activity and set start time features)</li>
</ul>
